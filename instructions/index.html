      <h1>Robot Car Instructions</h1>

      <p>
        Turn on the robot car by pressing the white power button on the top.
        This will make it try to join your wireless network and then begin
        listening for commands.
      </p>

      <p>
        If it's the first time with the car, you'll need to give it your
        network password.  Look for an "IoT Device" wireless network and 
        join it.  Go to <a href="http://192.168.4.1/">http://192.168.4.1/</a>
        and enter your network name (SSID) and password.  Leave the "extra
        configuration" link blank.  It can only join 2.4ghz networks, so if
        you have two networks, make sure to pick the right now.  Once you
        see the "thanks" message, turn the car off and back on.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few moments after starting up the car, go to
        <a href="http://patrickmcneill.com/car/">http://patrickmcneill.com/car/</a>.
        It will try to find your car on the network.  If it does, you'll see a
        set of buttons you can use to control it.  If not, try waiting longer and
        then reloading the page, or if that fails, re-running the setup.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're feeling brave, all of the code for the car is available at
        <a href="https://github.com/pmcneill/robocar">https://github.com/pmcneill/robocar</a>.
        If you make any changes to the control panel, for instance, you can send me
        a "pull request" and I can incorporate them into the live site.

        There are three extra pieces for the car: a set of lights and two
        bumpers.  The lights should be plugged into pin 5 on the main board,
        with the black wire closest to the edge.  The bumpers should be
        connected to pins 6 and 7 (their orientation isn't important).  Here's
        what that should look like:

        The screw terminals on the end of the controller board are where the motors
        and batteries are connected.  The battery power should be connected to the
        "V IN" (red wire) and "GND" (black) terminals.  The motors are connected
        to the "A+", "A-", "B+", and "B-" terminals.  The +/- on the motors is
        actually unimportant.  If you connect the wires and the car seems to go
        backwards, just swap the red and black wires to the other terminals.
      </p>

        I've included a battery box for 5 AA batteries.  It'd probably be a good idea
        to use rechargable batteries -- I'm not really sure how long the batteries will
        last.  The other possibility is to use an iPad/tablet external battery (not 
        just a phone battery, though -- the tablet batteries generally provide more
        current).  Cut a USB cable in half, then you should find red and black wires
        on the inside.
